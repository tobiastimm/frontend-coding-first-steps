# Exercise 01 - Welcome to HTML

ðŸ‘‹ Hello!
I'm glad you are here with me and we can start your great journey into the world of coding!

We will kick of the first exercise with HTML!

## Lesson

Facebook, Google, Instagram, Twitter, ... and all the websites you are using on a daily basis are built with three technolgies. HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

These three magical technologies complement eachother and are a must have to understand how the modern web is working.

The first of these three is HTML.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is as the name includes a markup language. The angle brackets `<body>` are typical for a markup language.
HTML is the browser tool for a logically structuring our content.

It is the major part needed to be able to display a website.

Every `.html` file starts with a `<!doctype>`. This signalises the browser that this is a [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5) document (Don't worry about what HTML5 or HTML4.1 is yet, the modern browsers are all using HTML5).

In every HTML document has three parts.

- Header
- Body
- Footer

## Goals

## Tips

To make it easier for you to remember, which technologies is responsible for what you can remember:

- HTML for logical structure (What I want to display)
- CSS to style content (How I want my content to be displayed)
- JS for adding dynamic stuff and programming (What should happen, if I hover over my content)
