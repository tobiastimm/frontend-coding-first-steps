# Exercise 03 - Down to the foot

## Lesson

Last but not least the `footer`. A `<footer>` typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.
It is not required to have a `footer` in an HTML file.

The footer always belongs to it's nearest anchestor.

```html
<article>
  <h1>How to be a wizard</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Grow a long, majestic beard.</li>
    <li>Wear a tall, pointed hat.</li>
    <li>Have I mentioned the beard?</li>
  </ol>
  <footer>
    <p>© 2018 Gandalf</p>
  </footer>
</article>
```

> Don't mind the `article`, `ol`, `li` tag. These are just different tags to structure data

## Goals

Add a proper `footer` to your website with an imprint like text.
